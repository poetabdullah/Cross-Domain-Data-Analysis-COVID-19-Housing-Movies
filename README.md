## <span style="color:#239B56;">üìù Description</span>

The **<span style="color:#F39C12;">Comprehensive Data Analysis Project</span>** is a multifaceted exploration into various aspects of data analysis, covering COVID-19 data visualization, SQL data cleaning and transformation, Excel data manipulation, and movie correlation analysis.

### <span style="color:#884EA0;">üîç Components Overview</span>

**<span style="color:#E74C3C;">1. COVID-19 Dashboard:</span>**
- A comprehensive Tableau dashboard offering insights into **<span style="color:#2980B9;">85,000+ global COVID-19 records</span>**.
- Visualizes key metrics such as infection rates, mortality rates, and recovery rates, revealing a **<span style="color:#C0392B;">2.11% global death rate</span>**, with **<span style="color:#9B59B6;">Europe</span>** having the highest mortality at **<span style="color:#D35400;">1M+ deaths</span>**.
- Interactive features allow users to customize views and explore data trends in detail.

**<span style="color:#16A085;">2. SQL Queries for Data Cleaning and Transformation:</span>**
- A collection of advanced SQL queries (using **<span style="color:#8E44AD;">CTEs, window functions, joins</span>**) designed to clean and transform raw COVID-19 data.
- Processes data for deeper analysis and visualization; cleaned data is integrated into the COVID-19 dashboard.

**<span style="color:#D4AC0D;">3. SQL Data Cleaning of Housing Excel File:</span>**
- Enhanced a **<span style="color:#2980B9;">56,000+ record housing dataset</span>** using SQL for date conversion, null value imputation, normalization to 1NF, and duplicate removal, optimizing data accuracy and analysis efficiency.

**<span style="color:#D68910;">4. Movie Correlation Analysis in Python:</span>**
- Analyzed **<span style="color:#3498DB;">7,600+ movie records</span>** in Python to identify a strong correlation (0.75) between budget and gross earnings using heatmaps and scatter plots.
- Provides insights into industry trends, helping optimize production investments.

## <span style="color:#F39C12;">üöÄ Usage</span>

- Download each file separately for individual use and analysis.
- Run SQL scripts in any compatible database environment, or visualize the data using Python or Tableau.
